# Weather Dashboard

## Description
Using the weather API I've created a weather forecast application.

Type in your city and hit search, the weather for the next five days will appear.

When the application is refreshed the past searches are displayed below the search bar as individual buttons. Unfortunately at this time the buttons do not display the weather. The local storage is stored correctly but it does not get displayed.

There is also a clear local storage button for the convience of the user.
